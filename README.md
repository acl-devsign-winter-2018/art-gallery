Lab: Art Gallery
===

Combining the techniques we've learned so far, build a themed app to showcase images you'll upload to Cloudinary. 

I'll accept a pretty broad definition of "art" (illustration, fashion, photography, flowers) as long as you showcase images using our new Picture component.

## Requirements
* Make it responsive, using a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox.
* Follow the Webpack component and router architecture we've used on other labs.
* Upload images to Cloudinary–check out their [image manipulation docs](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations)–and load them with our responsive Picture component.
* Apply subtle animations to reflect our previous labs.
* Sketch your responsive layout before developing.

## Submission Instructions
Submit pull request URL in Canvas, and include a .zip of your sketches.

Include the answers to the following in your submission:

* How long did you spend on this lab?
* Describe the process you used to complete the lab.
* What was the hardest and easiest part of the lab?

## Rubric
* Sketches used to plan out responsive layout (2 points)
* Subtle CSS animations applied (2 points)
* Images served from Cloudinary and image manipulation settings properly applied (3 points)
* Responsive images loading using Picture component (3 points)

## Stretch goal

I'll have to prepare and demo the lazy loading script tomorrow. Apply this for stretch goal points.
